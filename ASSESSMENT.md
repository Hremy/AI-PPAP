# Exercise 2: AI Powered Performance Analysis Platform

## A. Prerequisites:
- To be done individually
- Use AI for FullStack development
- Each should create his own repository on GitLab under his profile account
- No sharing of source codes
- Sharing prompts and discussion is allowed
- You are free to create your own look and feel and extend features as you want
- To be completed before 2nd - 5th September
- If you are still have unfinished activities on Learning Arena, please handle them in parallel, there is no more time

## B. Core Features

### Authentication & Roles
- Employee login (self review, performance history).
- Manager login (feedback + evaluation).
- Admin login (overall dashboards).

### Performance Score
- Standard KPIs (attendance, task completion, project delivery, etc.) stored in backend.
- AI computes a performance score by analyzing inputs (numeric + text feedback).

### Feedback & Reviews
- **Self-Review** → employees submit their self-evaluation (AI helps polish wording & check alignment with KPIs).
- **Manager Review** → managers provide textual + rating-based feedback.
- **60° / 360° Review** → peers/colleagues give feedback, AI summarizes into strengths & weaknesses.

### AI Integration
- **Text Analysis**: Sentiment analysis of feedback & self-review.
- **Summarization**: AI generates concise "Performance Summary Reports."
- **Recommendation Engine**: AI suggests growth areas (e.g., "Improve communication in team meetings").

### Dashboard (React)
- **Employee view** → personal performance history, score trends, AI insights.
- **Manager view** → team performance scores, comparative dashboards.
- **Admin view** → company-wide reports.

## C. Tech Stack:

### Backend (Java + Spring Boot)
- Auth (JWT + role-based).
- API endpoints for reviews, scores, dashboards.
- Database for employees, feedback entries, evaluations.

### Frontend (React + Tailwind)
- Employee & manager dashboards.
- Graphs (performance trends over time).
- AI feedback display (strengths, weaknesses, recommendations).

### AI Layer
- **Option 1**: Connect to Gemini / OpenAI / Hugging Face for NLP (summaries, recommendations, sentiment).
- **Option 2**: Use open-source models for local testing purpose
