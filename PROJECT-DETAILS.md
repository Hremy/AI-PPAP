# AI-Powered Performance Analysis Platform (PPAP)

## Project Overview
An intelligent performance analysis platform that leverages AI to provide comprehensive employee performance insights, feedback mechanisms, and growth recommendations.

## Core Features & Implementation Approaches

### 1. Authentication & Roles
**Requirements:**
- Employee login (self-review, performance history)
- Manager login (feedback + evaluation)
- Admin login (overall dashboards)

**Implementation Approaches:**
- Use Spring Security with JWT for authentication
- Implement role-based access control (ROLE_EMPLOYEE, ROLE_MANAGER, ROLE_ADMIN)
- Secure endpoints based on user roles
- Store user credentials securely with password hashing (BCrypt)

### 2. Performance Score System
**Requirements:**
- Track standard KPIs (attendance, task completion, project delivery)
- AI-computed performance score
- Historical performance tracking

**Implementation Approaches:**
- Design a flexible KPI scoring system
- Create database schema for storing performance metrics
- Implement weighted scoring algorithm
- Use AI to analyze trends and provide insights

### 3. Feedback & Reviews
**Requirements:**
- Self-review submission with AI assistance
- Manager reviews with ratings and feedback
- 60°/360° peer reviews

**Implementation Approaches:**
- Create review templates and workflows
- Implement AI-powered text analysis for feedback
- Design database schema for storing reviews and feedback
- Build notification system for review requests

### 4. AI Integration
**Requirements:**
- Text analysis for sentiment and themes
- Performance summary generation
- Growth recommendations

**Implementation Approaches:**
- Option 1: Integrate with external AI services (OpenAI, Gemini, Hugging Face)
- Option 2: Use open-source NLP models (spaCy, NLTK, Transformers)
- Implement caching for AI responses to reduce costs
- Create prompt templates for consistent AI outputs

### 5. Dashboard & Analytics
**Requirements:**
- Employee performance history
- Team performance comparisons
- Company-wide reporting

**Implementation Approaches:**
- Build responsive dashboards with React and Chart.js/Recharts
- Implement data aggregation services
- Create role-based dashboard views
- Add export functionality for reports
